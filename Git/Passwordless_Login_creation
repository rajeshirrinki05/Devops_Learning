To create a passwordless login from one Linux server to another, you can use SSH key-based authentication. Here are the steps:

1. **Generate SSH Key Pair on the Source Server:**
    Open a terminal on the source server and run the following command to generate an SSH key pair:
    ```sh
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```
    Press Enter to accept the default file location and provide a passphrase if desired.

2. **Copy the Public Key to the Destination Server:**
    Use the `ssh-copy-id` command to copy the public key to the destination server:
    ```sh
    ssh-copy-id user@destination_server
    ```
    Replace `user` with the username on the destination server and `destination_server` with the IP address or hostname of the destination server. You will be prompted to enter the password for the user on the destination server.

3. **Verify Passwordless Login:**
    Now, try to log in to the destination server from the source server without a password:
    ```sh
    ssh user@destination_server
    ```
    If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to log in without being prompted for a password.

These steps will set up passwordless SSH login from one Linux server to another.
